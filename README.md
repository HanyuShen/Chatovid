## Installing
Install node.js LTS ([LINK](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)).
Run `npm i` in the root project directory. This will fetch all modules into node_modules/. (I haven't included them in the repo because they weight like 150MB)

## Running
Run `node app.js` to start the server.

The app can  accessed at `localhost:3000`
